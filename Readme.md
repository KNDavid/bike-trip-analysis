# Ford GoBike Data Exploration

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about bike share trips in the San Francisco Bay Area. The dataset contains information about the start and end times of trips, as well as information about the users, including user type and gender. The dataset contains 183,412 observations and 16 variables.

In the data exploration, I first assessed the quality of the data, including missing values. I then proceeded to clean the data, including converting data types and creating new columns for analysis. After cleaning the data, I performed an exploratory analysis of the data, which included generating visualizations to summarize the data and identify trends and patterns.

## Summary of Findings
The data exploration revealed several interesting findings about the Bike trips.

- The majority of bike users were subscribers.
- There were more bike trips on weekdays than weekends.
- Bike trip usage peaked during commuting hours.
- There were more male users than female or other gender users.
- Trip duration varied by user type and start time.
- The steps taken during the data exploration included cleaning the data, generating visualizations, and identifying trends and patterns. -The findings from the exploration will be used to guide the creation of the explanatory analysis.

## Key Insights for Presentation

The visualizations used in the explanatory analysis will include bar charts, point plots, and count plots to convey the insights effectively. Some visualizations will be modified or added to better communicate the insights to the audience. Overall, the findings from the data exploration was used to create a compelling and informative explanatory analysis.
